/***@defgroup m17nDatabaseFormat DatabaseFormat

This section describes the formats of predefined @e plist @e type data
in the m17n database.

@section general General format

The m17n library expects that the function mdatabase_load () returns a
plist of a specific format on loading data identified by a specific
set of tags.  As the plist format used for the database data is
strongly limited, we can use the equivalent text of simple syntax
(S-expression) to represent the plist as below.

The text consists of one or more @e elements .  Each element
represents a property, i.e. a single element of a plist, and the
sequence of the elements constitute a plist.

Elements are separated by one or more @e whitespaces, i.e. a space
(code 32), a tab (code 9), or a newline (code 10).  Comments begin
with a semicolon (<tt>;</tt>) and extend to the end of the line.

The key and the value of each property are determined based on the
form of element as below:

<ul>

<li> INTEGER

An element that matches the regular expression @c -?[0-9]+ or @c
0[xX][0-9A-Fa-f]+ represents a property whose key is @c Minteger .  An
element matching the former expression is interpreted as an integer in
decimal notation, and one matching the latter expression is
interpreted as an integer in hexadecimal notation.  The resulting
integer is the value of the property.

For instance, the element 0xA0 represents a property whose value is
the integer 160.

<li> SYMBOL

An element that matchs the regular expression @c
[^-0-9(]([^\\()]|\\.)+ represents a property whose key is @c Msymbol .
In the sequence, @c \\t , @c \\n , @c \\r , and @c \\e are replaced
with tab (code 9), newline (code 10), carriage return (code 13), and
escape (code 27) respectively.  Other characters following a backslash
is interpreted as it is.  The symbol having the name of the resulting
sequence is the value of the property.

For instance, the element <tt>abc\ def</tt> represents a property
whose value is the symbol of name "abc def".

<li> M-TEXT

An element that matches the regular expression @c "([^"]|\\")*"
represents a property whose key is @c Mtext .  The backslash escape
explained above also applies here.  Moreover, each part in the
sequence matching the regular expression @c
\\[xX][0-9A-Fa-f][0-9A-Fa-f] is replaced with its hexadecimal
interpretation.

After having resolved the backslash escapes, the byte sequence between
the double quotes is interpreted as a UTF-8 sequence and decoded into
an M-text.  This M-text is the value of the property.

<li> PLIST

An element that is preceded by a left parenthesis, followed zero or
more elements, and terminated by a right parenthesis represents a
property whose key is @c Mplist .  Parentheses also serve as a
separator, which means whitespaces before and after a parenthesis can
be omitted.  The value of the property is a plist, which is the result
of recursive interpretation of the elements between the parentheses.

</ul>

EXAMPLE

Suppose (K1:V1, K2:V2, ... ,Kn:Vn) represents a plist whose first
property key and value are K1 and V1, second key and value are K2 and
V2, and so on.  Then the line:
@verbatim
abc 123 (pqr 0xff) "m\"text" (_\\_ ("string" xyz) -456)
@endverbatim
is interpreted as follows.
@verbatim
(Msymbol:abc,
 Minteger:123,
 Mplist:(Msymbol:pqr,
         Minteger:255),
 Mtext:m"text,
 Mplist:(Msymbol:_\_,
         Mplist:(Mtext:string,
                 Msymbol:xyz),
         Minteger:-456))
@endverbatim

The default database loader of the m17n library actually read a text
of this syntax from the database file.

Here after we describes the plist format of each data by this syntax.
